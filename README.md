Scenario 1-
No Metadata leaks, is it?

One fine day she was alerted by a friendly hacker that a bug in the code leads to compromise of a storage account. Try to investigate the incident by reproducing the attack chain. Source code is hosted on this git repo for reference. The URL of hosting- http://mywebapp.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:5000/test_ssrf. 

Scenario 2-
Use your creativity for a shortcut of Scenario 1.

Scenario 3-
From publicly exposed storage to a compromised database!
